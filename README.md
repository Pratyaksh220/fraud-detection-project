# Fraud Detection Project

This project demonstrates a basic fraud detection model using synthetic data.

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and notebooks for:
- Generating synthetic data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building and evaluating a fraud detection model

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-project.git
   cd fraud-detection-project
# fraud-detection-project

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run python src/fraud_detection.py to execute the fraud detection pipeline.
Modify parameters or algorithms as needed in src/fraud_detection.py.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic dataset
X, y = make_classification(
    n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, weights=[0.99, 0.01], random_state=42
)

df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=[f'feature_{i}' for i in range(1, 21)])
df['target'] = y

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    df.drop('target', axis=1), df['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Initialize the model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print(f'Confusion Matrix:\n{conf_matrix}')

# Visualization example
plt.hist(df['feature_1'])
